# TweetSplit
This is example written by java
Screen:
   - History: show all message which you sent
   - New Message: Allow the user to input and send messages
Features:
   - If a user's input is less than or equal to 50 characters, post it as is.
   - If a user's input is greater than 50 characters, split it into chunks that each is less than or equal to 50 characters and post each chunk as a separate message.
   - The functionality that splits messages should be a standalone function. Given the above example, its function call would look like:
```
splitMessage("I can't believe Tweeter now supports chunking my messages, so I don't have to do it myself.")
```
and it would return
```
["1/2 I can't believe Tweeter now supports chunking", "2/2 my messages, so I don't have to do it myself."]
```
